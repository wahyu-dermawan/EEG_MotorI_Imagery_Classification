# EEG_MotorI_Imagery_Classification
Classification of EEG Motor Imagery by modified CSP and LDA Classifier.
We use MATLAB environment to build the algorhitm

The data was retrieved from Open Source data : http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets

This project is about classifying the Motor Imagery (MI) movements ('Open and Grasp') using the Modifien Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). Then we use the Linear Discriminant Analysis to define the classes and in order to achieve the accuracy of CSP algorhitm.
